Java File Descriptions
=--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------=
Activity files:
    MainActivity : This file contains all the chart screen logic. Includes 4 tabs which scope
                   to the different time frames and a chart for each tab with buttons under each
                   chart to scope to previous periods of time. Also includes a message box for
                   the suggestion based on the trend of the chart. Each tab is associated with
                   a GraphFragment.
    LoginActivity : This file contains all login screen logic. This includes logging in and
                    authenticating the user through the server.

                       the user through the server.

    GraphFragment : This file contains the chart logic. This sets up the chart and also requests
                    data from the backend to populate the chart with. This also handles the touch
                    for the user to interact with the chart to see what points. Note this isn't
                    an activity, but a Fragment that is associated with each tab in the
                    MainActivity.

                  and JSONParsing for return data.
    DB : Interface to add, delete and update the phone's local SQL database
    SessionManager : Interface to interact with shared preferences and persist login information.
    JSONParser : Interface to Handle JSON Parsing of Http post and get requests.
